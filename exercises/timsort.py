    Create the code for the timsort algorithm described here:
    https://skerritt.blog/timsort-the-fastest-sorting-algorithm-youve-never-heard-of/

    The code is also provided in this article, but the result of this exercise should be that you will be able to describe algorithm and the code, like if you where at an exam.
    So when you fell done, explain the algorithm and code to your sideman in class.
